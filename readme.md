Hi, welcome to the V2 discord bot.

This is a bot that I made in my free time, if you have any suggestions on how I could improve the project, let me know.

To run the bot make sure to rename the .env.example to .env and fill out the info.
(OWNER, TMEMBER and NMEMBER are id's from people in the server this bot is made for.)

Then run node index.js and you're good to go!

If you need any help, you can join the V2 server and tag the owner.
